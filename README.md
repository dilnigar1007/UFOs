# UFOs
### Overview of Project
In this module, we created a table with all UFO sightings information with date filter only. In this project, we added a couple of more filters: City, State, Country, and Shape. This was the hardest part of this challenge. Adding the filter wasn't bad since we already knew how to add a filter by adding the date filter, but saving the value after filtering was a bit challenge.
